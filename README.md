 ### Concept
 
 A webapp that allows for a user to store financial costs and incomes and allows for a variety of queries and statistics to be handled. The app will support auth and loading in standardized files from prominent banking apps as well as a couple of interesting templates.
 
 This is developed as a chill coding session concept, thus no predefined architecture will be declared. I code as I go.
